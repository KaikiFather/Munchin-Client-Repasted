# Munchin Client: Repasted
A faithful restoration of Münchin Client

Merry Christmas melon users, we've been working very hard this last week to get this beta re-release of münch out for you guys on Christmas, and there are some things you should know about this before you run it, my absolute intention was to restore this mod from its depreciated state (completely dysfunctional button api, many broken features and a handful of broken patches) but it is not exactly as it was before, namely some things I’ve gone out of my way to remove these are: Appbots, server connections (in their entirety for now), VRCA/W downloading, and event related features that if not perfectly adjusted that could lead to player bans. Beyond that every feature that is not yet implemented and/or fixed from the original version of münch I plan on fixing, if not already fixed or working. 

# A message for Killer_Bigpoint
We’ve talked briefly before and in those conversations I’ve suggested you open source your client, this is a game after all and obfuscation above all hurts nobody but the end user, sure your anti leak and .net reactor protected your source code (for a period of time) from people who wanted to use your genuinely crafted features in their own work for their own benefit (which this is not, and also why my name will not appear on this repository), but this was in turn hypocritical, the help you got directly from others and indirectly from other peoples open sourced work is plenty enough reason to have at least left your work unobfuscated, not only so people could really see the compilation of your work, but also so people could learn from it as you did from other peoples work. This is not even counter intuitive to the idea of selling your work because you had a online authentication system, that provided many positive features to your clients ecosystem that any open source paste from it would not be able use without a certain level of personal effort to recreate, over with Area51 we never had any issues with selling, even though every single bit of code we released was open sourced, (some of us more ‘inspired’ than others in our work), regardless it still sold, and the end user not only could learn from our work, but they could know the thing they paid money for was safe. 

I was a happy münchin user pre-EAC and I wanted nothing more than for it to stay around, but still even after numerous complete source code leaks you refused to move to an open source model. This among other good reasons, me and my close friend have put a lot of work into reviving your *discontinued* melonloader mod. I have no plans to stop maintaining and improving this source code, even beyond this repository, if taken down, I will keep this work open sourced and everything will be free for all who still use melonloader for vrc, until it is no longer possible.

# A note about pipsqueak and c++ münch
I do not know how pipsqueak infiltrated your orbiters, but I cannot stress enough that this was a horrible idea, not only for the (almost) spotless reputation of your work, but for the good name of your client. I do know though, where pipsqueak was before he got to know you, long before EAC pipsqueak was brought into (you probably haven’t heard about this one) Area51, he was basically shoved into our group by the co-owner at the time Fish (who’s reputation I made sure to personally ruin after he token logged my friend), regardless fish brought pipsqueak onto our project to replace me as the photon bot developer, this was short lived as eventually fish and pipsqueak decided they didn’t like their cut and wanted to steal all the source code (open source mind you, really smart guys I know), blow up our Client server at the time and claim to be the new owners of the source and tried renaming themselves as a group to I think beanbag or trinix? In a horrible attempt to steal our user base. it was stupid and short lived though because shortly after this unnecessary mutiny area51 was back to normal and Pipsqueak attempted to steal fishes girlfriend and then their project was dead on the spot. Let this be a warning to not only prospective münchin c++ users but killer himself, when pip is holding the bag, if you’re not paying attention he will turn around and sell it out from under you, I can guarantee you this.

# Credits
Killer_Bigpoint#9999
The original developer, without you this would not exist.

Pipsqueak#0002
Inspiring me with your inability to follow through on anything, your excessively slow work towards recoding and releasing munch again was pivotal in the creation of this project. Without you being tied up in this, I probably would’ve spent my time doing something else.

Kanna#2950 - Tester, Co-ReDeveloper
One of the best people I’ve met on vrc, I never would’ve learned to code if it wasn’t for you, you’ve inspired me time and time again to push the envelope of what I thought I was capable of, without you I would not be the person I am now, nor would this project exist. Beyond all other credits the biggest shoutout goes to you.

ItsSnow#1765 - Secondary Tester
Many thanks for your work in helping me test this out so I could get it out to people quicker, you’ve always been a bro.

 UrFingPoor(aka Josh)
As unpopular in the community as he was Josh was integral in the development of my methodology, he inspired me greatly in how he would help whoever wanted to learn, and was always willing to share his work, regardless of where he may have learned it from himself, shameless and confident, josh only plays the role you’ve all gave him, but as a person he never wanted to hurt anyone seriously, and I have genuine respect for him. Without you this project would probably be closed source and sold to the highest bidder, your inspiration to me was invaluable, and will stick with me for a lifetime.

xAstroBoy#1337
Doubly unpopular to the community, astro was the only one of you that had any hope for a melonloader revival, besides those who’ve done the work to make it happen. He’s always been helpful to me when I’ve had questions, and was always willing to share what he’s learned so that others could learn from him, annoying as some may think he is, I respect him and his work (regardless of how many errors it throws) thank you for the Hud popup code.

Jack
Even though I’ve talked to you more than most in the community I still know less about you than I’d like, but you bringing melonloader back was one of the coolest things anybody in the community has done, your contribution will not be forgotten.

Anybody else who’s contributed to Münchin
(Directly or indirectly)
This source would not exist without the I’m sure many people who have contributed to this mega melon mod, And I’m sorry I cannot list you all here, if you can find me on discord dm me (with proof) and I will add you here.

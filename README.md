# Munchin Client: Repasted
A faithful restoration of Münchin Client

Merry Christmas melon users, we've been working very hard this last week to get this beta re-release of münch out for you guys on Christmas, and there are some things you should know about this before you run it, my absolute intention was to restore this mod from its depreciated state (completely dysfunctional button api, many broken features and a handful of broken patches) but it is not exactly as it was before, namely some things I’ve gone out of my way to remove these are: Appbots, server connections (in their entirety for now), VRCA/W downloading, and event related features that if not perfectly adjusted that could lead to player bans. Beyond that every feature that is not yet implemented and/or fixed from the original version of münch I plan on fixing, if not already fixed or working. 

# Credits
#### Killer_Bigpoint#9999
The original developer, without you this would not exist. Thanks for supporting this project and doing the right thing, this project will continue to improve quickly because of your support.

#### Kanna#2950 - Tester, Co-ReDeveloper
One of the best people I’ve met on vrc, I never would’ve learned to code if it wasn’t for you, you’ve inspired me time and time again to push the envelope of what I thought I was capable of, without you I would not be the person I am now, nor would this project exist. Beyond all other credits the biggest shoutout goes to you.

#### ItsSnow#1765 - Secondary Tester
Many thanks for your work in helping me test this out so I could get it out to people quicker, you’ve always been a bro.

#### UrFingPoor(aka Josh)
As unpopular in the community as he was Josh was integral in the development of my methodology, he inspired me greatly in how he would help whoever wanted to learn, and was always willing to share his work, regardless of where he may have learned it from himself, shameless and confident, josh only plays the role you’ve all gave him, but as a person he never wanted to hurt anyone seriously, and I have genuine respect for him. Without you this project would probably be closed source and sold to the highest bidder, your inspiration to me was invaluable, and will stick with me for a lifetime.

#### xAstroBoy#1337
Doubly unpopular to the community, astro was the only one of you that had any hope for a melonloader revival, besides those who’ve done the work to make it happen. He’s always been helpful to me when I’ve had questions, and was always willing to share what he’s learned so that others could learn from him, annoying as some may think he is, I respect him and his work (regardless of how many errors it throws) thank you for the Hud popup code.

#### Jack
Even though I’ve talked to you more than most in the community I still know less about you than I’d like, but you bringing melonloader back was one of the coolest things anybody in the community has done, your contribution will not be forgotten.

Anybody else who’s contributed to Münchin
(Directly or indirectly)
This source would not exist without the I’m sure many people who have contributed to this mega melon mod, And I’m sorry I cannot list you all here, if you can find me on discord dm me (with proof) and I will add you here.

#### NotZetrex
